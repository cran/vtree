# Introduction

`vtree` is a flexible tool for generating *variable trees* &mdash;
diagrams that display information about nested subsets of a data frame.
Given simple specifications,
`vtree` produces these diagrams and automatically labels them with counts,
percentages, and other summaries.
With `vtree`, you can:

* explore a data set interactively, and

* produce customized figures for reports and publications.

## Two examples

*Subsets* play an important role in almost any data analysis.
Imagine a data set of countries,
with variables named `population`, `continent`, and `landlocked`.
We might wish to examine subsets of the data set based on the `continent` variable.
Within each of these subsets,
we might wish to examine *nested* subsets based on the `population` variable,
for example, countries with populations under 30 million and over 30 million.
We might continue to a third level of nesting based on the `landlocked` variable.
`vtree` provides a general solution to the problem of calculating nested subsets
and displaying information about them.
Nested subsets help us to answer questions like the following:
*Among African countries with a population over 30 million, what percentage are landlocked?*

The variable tree below answers this question:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- build.data.frame(
  c("continent","population","landlocked"),
  list("Africa","Over 30 million","landlocked",2),
  list("Africa","Over 30 million","not landlocked",12),
  list("Africa","Under 30 million","landlocked",14),
  list("Africa","Under 30 million","not landlocked",26))
```

`r vtree(df,"continent population landlocked",showroot=FALSE,pxwidth=1000)`

Even in simple situations like this,
it can be a chore to keep track of nested subsets and to calculate percentages.
But it's often even more tedious&mdash;and there are two reasons why. 
First, the presence of missing values makes it harder to determine denominators.
Second, as the number of variables increases,
the number of nested subsets grows rapidly.
In spite of these difficulties,
people often calculate nested subsets by hand 
(along with percentages and other summaries).
Not only is this tiresome work, it is extremely error prone.

Nested subsets arise in all kinds of situations.
Consider, for example, flow diagrams for clinical studies,
such as the following rudimentary
[CONSORT](http://www.consort-statement.org) diagram,
which is also a variable tree.

`r 
vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup",plain=TRUE,
  keep=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility",
  width=230,height=500,pxwidth=500,imageheight="4.5in")
`

Because manual calculation and transcription are error-prone,
mistakes in published flow diagrams are all too common.
And although the errors that make it to publication are often small,
they can sometimes be disastrous.

Note that at the end of this vignette, there is a collection of [examples using R datasets](#RdatasetExamples) that you can try.

## Basic features of a variable tree

The examples that follow use a data set called `FakeData` which represents
`r nrow(FakeData)` fictitious patients.
The variable tree below depicts subsets defined by `Sex` (M or F)
nested within subsets defined by disease `Severity`
(Mild, Moderate, Severe, or NA).
Although this example&mdash;and many subsequent ones&mdash;use just two variables,
variable trees are especially useful with three or more variables.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
cat(vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",showlegend=FALSE,horiz=FALSE,
  width=600,height=200,pxwidth=1000,imageheight="2.2in"))
```

A variable tree consists of *nodes* connected by arrows.
At the top of the diagram above, the *root* node of the tree contains all 46 patients.
The rest of the nodes are arranged in successive levels,
where each level corresponds to a variable.
Note that this highlights one difference between variable trees
and some other kinds of trees:
at each level of a variable tree, regardless of the branch,
the nodes represent values of the same variable.
(*Decision trees*, in contrast,
can have splits on different variables at the same level.)
 
Continuing with the variable tree above,
the nodes immediately below the root represent values of `Severity` and
are referred to as the *children* of the root node.
In this case, `Severity` was missing (NA) for 6 patients,
and there is a node for these patients.
Inside each of the nodes, the number of patients is displayed
and---except for in the missing value node---the corresponding percentage is also shown.
Note that, by default, `vtree` displays "valid" percentages,
i.e. the denominator used to calculate the percentage is the total number of non-missing values,
`r sum(!is.na(FakeData$Severity))`.

The final level of the tree corresponds to values of `Sex`.
These nodes represent males and females *within subsets* defined by each value of `Severity`.
In each of these nodes the percentage is calculated in terms of
the number of patients in its parent node.

Like any node, a missing-value node can have children.
For example, of the 6 patients for whom `Severity` is missing, 3 are female and 3 are male.
By default, `vtree` displays the full missing-value structure of the specified variables.

Also by default, `vtree` automatically assigns a color palette to each variable.
`Severity` has been assigned red hues (lightest for Mild, darkest for Severe),
while `Sex` has been assigned blue hues (light blue for females, dark blue for males).
The node representing missing values of `Severity` is colored white to draw attention to it.


## Variable trees compared to contingency tables

A tree with two variables is similar to a two-way contingency table.
In the example above, `Sex` is shown within levels of `Severity`.
This corresponds to the following contingency table,
where the percentages within each column add to 100%.
These are called *column percentages*.

&nbsp;| Mild      | Moderate | Severe   | NA
------|-----------|----------|----------|---------
**F** | 11 (58%)  | 11 (69%) | 2 (40%)  | 3 (50%)
**M** | 8 (42%)   | 5 (31%)  | 3 (60%)  | 3 (50%)

Likewise, a tree with `Severity` shown within levels of `Sex` corresponds to
a contingency table with *row percentages*.

The contingency table above is more compact than the corresponding variable tree,
but some people may find the variable tree easier to interpret.
When three of more variables are of interest,
multi-way contingency tables are often used.
These are typically displayed using several two-way tables.
In this situation, variable trees are generally easier to interpret.

It is also worth noting that
contingency tables are not *always* more compact than variable trees.
When most cells of a large contingency table are empty (in which case the table is said to be *sparse*),
the corresponding variable tree may be more compact since empty-nodes are not shown.
 

## Features of vtree

`vtree` is designed to be quick and easy to use,
so that it is convenient for data exploration,
but also flexible enough that it can be used to prepare publication-ready figures.
To generate a basic variable tree,
it is only necessary to provide `vtree` with a data frame and some variable names.
However extra features make `vtree` much more useful. 
`vtree` provides:

* control over [labeling](#labeling), colors, [legends](#legends), [line wrapping](#wrapping),
[text formatting](#textFormatting) and other customization features;

* flexible [pruning](#pruning) to remove parts of the tree that are of lesser interest,
which is particularly useful when a tree gets large;

* [display of information about other variables in each node](#summary),
including a variety of summary statistics;

* special displays for [indicator variables](#Venn),
[patterns](#patterns) of values, and
[missingness](#missingValues);

* support for [checkbox variables](#REDCapCheckboxes) from [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org) databases;

* features for [dichotomizing variables](#dichotomizing) and [checking for outliers](#detectingOutliers); and

* automatic generation of PNG image files and [embedding in R Markdown](#embeddingInRmarkdown) documents.

In many cases, you may wish to generate several different variable trees to
investigate a collection of variables in a data frame.
For example, it is often useful to change the order of variables,
prune parts of the tree, etc.


## Technical overview

`vtree` is built on open-source software:
in particular Richard Iannone's
[DiagrammeR](http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/) package,
which provides an interface to the
[Graphviz](https://www.graphviz.org/) software using the
[htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework.
A formal description of variable trees follows.

The root node of the variable tree represents the entire data frame.
The root node has a child for each observed value of the first variable that was specified.
Each of these child nodes represents a subset of the data frame with a specific value of the variable, and is labeled with the number of observations in the subset and the corresponding percentage of the number of observations in the entire data frame.
The *n*^th^ level below the root of the variable tree corresponds to the *n*^th^ variable specified.
Apart from the root node,
each node in the variable tree represents the subset of its parent defined by a specific observed value of the variable at that level of the tree,
and is labeled with the number of observations in that subset and the corresponding percentage of the number of observations in its parent node.

Note that a node always represents at least one observation.
And unlike a contingency table,
which can have empty cells,
a variable tree has no empty nodes.


# The `vtree` function

Consider a data frame named `df`,
which includes discrete variables `v1` and `v2`.
In this case, a variable tree can be displayed using the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(df,"v1 v2")
```

For additional details about how variables can be specified,
see the section on [specification of variables](#VariableSpecification) below.
Note that if `vtree` is called without a list of variables,
it uses *all* of the variables in the data frame
in the order in which they appear.

Numerous additional parameters can be supplied.
For example, by default `vtree` produces a horizontal tree
(that is, a tree that grows from left to right).
To generate a vertical tree, specify `horiz=FALSE`.


## Mini tutorial

To display a variable tree for a single variable, say `Severity`, use the following command:

```{r,eval=FALSE, results="asis"}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity")
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",width=250,height=250,pxwidth=300,imageheight="2.5in")`

Next, consider a vertical variable tree with two variables, `Severity` and `Sex`.
A less colorful display with more spacing can be requested by specifying `plain=TRUE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",horiz=FALSE,plain=TRUE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",horiz=FALSE,plain=TRUE,
  width=450,height=200,pxwidth=1600,imageheight="1.8in")`


### Percentages

By default, "valid percentages" are shown,
i.e. the denominator is the total number of *non-missing* values.
In the case of `Severity`, there are `r sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity))` missing values,
so the denominator is `r nrow(FakeData)` - `r sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity))` ,
or `r nrow(FakeData) - sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity))`.
There are `r sum(FakeData$Severity %in% "Mild")` Mild cases,
and `r sum(FakeData$Severity %in% "Mild")`/`r nrow(FakeData) - sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity))` =
`r sum(FakeData$Severity %in% "Mild")/(nrow(FakeData) - sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity)))` so the percentage shown is 48%.
No percentage is shown in the NA node since missing values are not included in the denominator.

If you prefer that the denominator represent the complete set of observations
(*including* any missing values),
specify `vp=FALSE`.
With this setting, a percentage will be shown in each of the nodes,
including any NA nodes.

If you don't wish to see percentages, specify `showpct=FALSE`,
and if you don't wish to see counts, specify `showcount=FALSE`.


### Displaying a legend and hiding node labels {#legends}

To display a legend, specify `showlegend=TRUE`.
Next to each level of the tree,
the variable name is displayed together with color discs and the values they correspond to.
For each of the values, overall (*marginal*) counts are shown, together with percentages.

When the legend is shown, the node labels become redundant,
since the colors identify the values of the variables
(although the labels may aid readability).
If you prefer, you can hide the node labels,
by specifying `shownodelabels=FALSE`:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",showlegend=TRUE,shownodelabels=FALSE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",showlegend=TRUE,shownodelabels=FALSE,
  width=550,height=450,pxwidth=800,imageheight="4in")`
  
The legend shows how colors are assigned to the different values of each variable,
and additionally provides marginal (that is, overall) counts and percentages for each variable.
Since `Severity` is the first variable in the tree---i.e., it is not nested within another variable---
the marginal counts and percentages for `Severity` are identical to those displayed in the nodes.
In contrast, for `Sex`, the marginal counts and percentages are different
from what is shown in the nodes because the nodes for `Sex` are nested with levels of `Severity`.

(Unfortunately the NA circle in the legend is oddly sized and positioned due to an issue with the corresponding unicode symbols.)


### Putting node labels on the same line as the counts and percentages

When a variable tree is large,
it can be difficult to display it in a readable way.
One approach that helps is to display the tree horizontally
and also to put the node labels on the same
line as the counts and percentage by specifying `sameline=TRUE`.
For example,
the following results in nodes with single-lines labels such as **Moderate, 16 (40%)**, etc.:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex Viral",sameline=TRUE)
```



### Hiding variable names

By default, next to each level of the tree, `vtree` shows the variable name.
These can be removed by specifying `showvarnames=FALSE`.


### Text wrapping {#wrapping}

By default,
`vtree` wraps text onto the next line whenever a space occurs after at least 20 characters.
This can be adjusted, for example, to 15 characters,
by specifying `splitwidth=15`.
To disable line splitting, specify `splitwidth=Inf`.
Text wrapping in the legend is controlled independently.
To set the splitting in the legend to 8 characters,
specify `lsplitwidth=8`.
Also note that in the legend,
text wrapping can take place not only at spaces,
but also at any of the following characters: . - + _ = /

*This concludes the mini-tutorial.*
`vtree` has many more features, described in the following sections.

 
## Pruning {#pruning}

When a variable tree gets too big,
or you are only interested in certain parts of the tree,
it may be useful to remove some nodes along with their descendants.
This is known as *pruning*.
For convenience, `vtree` provides several different ways to prune a tree,
described below.

### The `prune` parameter

Suppose you don't want the tree to include individuals whose disease is Mild or Moderate.
Specifying `prune=list(Severity=c("Mild","Moderate"))`
removes those nodes, and all of their descendants:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",prune=list(Severity=c("Mild","Moderate")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",prune=list(Severity=c("Mild","Moderate")),
  width=500,height=300,pxwidth=600,imageheight="2.5in")`

In general,
the argument of the `prune` parameter is a list with an element named for each variable you wish to prune.
In the example above, the list has a single element, named `Severity`.
In turn, that element is a vector `c("Mild","Moderate")`
indicating the values of `Severity` to prune.

**Caution**: Once a variable tree has been pruned,
it is no longer complete.
This can sometimes be confusing since not all observations
are represented at certain levels of the tree.
**It is particularly important to avoid pruning missing value nodes**,
since this makes it hard to interpret "valid" percentages (i.e. percentages calculated
using the number of non-missing observations as denominator).


### The `keep` parameter

Sometimes it is more convenient to specify which nodes should be *retained*
rather than which ones should be discarded.
The `keep` parameter is used for this purpose,
and can thus be considered the complement of the `prune` parameter.

For example, to retain only the Moderate `Severity` node:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",keep=list(Severity="Moderate"))
```

#### Missing value nodes and the `keep` parameter

It is important to note how the `keep` parameter functions
when missing values are present.
Consider a variable tree for the `Severity` variable,
shown on the left with so-called "valid" percentages.
These are percentages calculated using the number of non-missing observations as denominator
(which is the default, specified by `vp=TRUE`).
On the right is the same tree,
but with percentages calculated using the total number of observations as the denominator.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity")
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",vp=FALSE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",imagewidth="1.5in",pxwidth=400)`
`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",vp=FALSE,imagewidth="1.5in",pxwidth=400)`

Suppose we use `keep` to retain only the Moderate node.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",keep=list(Severity="Moderate"))
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",vp=FALSE,keep=list(Severity="Moderate"))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",keep=list(Severity="Moderate"),imagewidth="1.5in",pxwidth=400)`
`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",vp=FALSE,keep=list(Severity="Moderate"),imagewidth="1.5in",pxwidth=400)`

Note that in the tree on the left (which uses valid percentages),
the NA node is retained.
This is done so that the percentage of Moderate cases can be interpreted..
(There are `r sum(FakeData$Severity=="Moderate",na.rm=TRUE)` Moderate cases,
and a total of `r sum(!is.na(FakeData$Severity))` non-missing cases,
which is
`r round(100*sum(FakeData$Severity=="Moderate",na.rm=TRUE)/sum(!is.na(FakeData$Severity)))`%.)

On the right, the NA node has been removed, 
because the denominator (`r nrow(FakeData)`) doesn't depend on the number of missing values.


### The `prunebelow` parameter

A disadvantage of the `prune` parameter is that in the resulting tree,
the counts shown in child nodes may not add up to the counts shown in the parent node.
For example in the variable tree above,
of a total of `r nrow(FakeData)` patients,
`r sum(!is.na(FakeData$Severity) & FakeData$Severity=="Severe")`
have Severe disease and `Severity` is unknown for `r sum(is.na(FakeData$Severity))`.
One might wonder what happened to the other `r sum(!is.na(FakeData$Severity) & FakeData$Severity!="Severe")` patients.

A solution to this problem is to retain the specified nodes,
but to prune *below* them (i.e. to prune their descendants).
In the present example, this means that the Mild and Moderate nodes will be shown,
but not their descendants.
The `prunebelow` parameter is used to do this,
and its argument has the same form as for the `prune` parameter. 
 
```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",prunebelow=list(Severity=c("Mild","Moderate")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",prunebelow=list(Severity=c("Mild","Moderate")),
  width=500,height=300,pxwidth=600,imageheight="3in")`

### The `follow` parameter
 
The complement of the `prunebelow` function is the `follow` function.
Instead of specifying which nodes should be pruned below,
this allows you to specify which nodes should be "followed" (that is, *not* pruned below).


### The `prunesmaller` parameter

As a variable tree grows it can become difficult to see the forest for the tree.
For example, consider the following variable tree:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex Age Category",sameline=TRUE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex Age Category",sameline=TRUE,imageheight="7in",pxwidth=800)`

One solution is to prune nodes that contain small numbers of observations.
For example if you want to only see nodes with at least 3 observations,
you can specify `prunesmaller=3`, as in this example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex Age Category",sameline=TRUE,prunesmaller=3)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex Age Category",sameline=TRUE,prunesmaller=3,
  imageheight="5in",pxwidth=1200)`

As with the `keep` parameter,
when `vp=TRUE` (which is the default, and means that valid percentages are shown), 
nodes represent missing values will not be pruned.
(As noted in the section on the `keep` parameter,
this is because percentages are confusing when missing values are not shown.)
When `vp=FALSE`, missing nodes will be pruned (if they are small enough).


## Labels for variables and nodes {#labeling}

By default, `vtree` labels variables and nodes exactly as they are in the data frame.
But it is often useful to change these labels.

### Changing variable labels with the `labelvar` parameter

Suppose `Severity` in fact represents initial severity.
To label it that way in the variable tree,
specify `labelvar=c(Severity="Initial severity")`.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",horiz=FALSE,labelvar=c(Severity="Initial severity"))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",horiz=FALSE,
  labelvar=c(Severity="Initial severity"),
  width=700,height=250,pxwidth=1200,imageheight="2.2in")`
  
  
### Changing node labels with the `labelnode` parameter

By default, `vtree` labels nodes (except for the root node)
using the values of the variable in question.
(If the variable is a factor, the levels of the factor are used).
Sometimes it is convenient to instead specify custom labels for nodes.
You can use the `labelnode` argument to relabel the values.
For example, you might want to use "Male" and "Female" instead of "M" and "F".

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Group Sex",horiz=FALSE,labelnode=list(Sex=c(Male="M",Female="F")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Group Sex",horiz=FALSE,labelnode=list(Sex=c(Male="M",Female="F")),
  width=700,height=250,pxwidth=800,imageheight="2.2in")`

The `labelnode` argument argument is specified as a list whose element names are variable names.
To substitute `New label` for `Old label`,
the syntax is: `"New label"="Old label"`.
Thus the full specification is: `labelnode=list(Sex=c(Male="M",Female="F"))`.

### Targeted node labels using the `tlabelnode` parameter

Suppose in the example above that `Group` A represents children and
`Group` B represents adults.
In `Group` A, we would like to use the labels "girl" and "boy",
while in `Group` B we would like to use "woman" and "man".
The `labelnode` parameter cannot handle this situation because the values of
`Sex` need to labeled differently in different branches of the tree.
The `tlabelnode` parameter allows "targeted" node labels.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Group Sex",horiz=FALSE,
  labelnode=list(Group=c(Child="A",Adult="B")),
  tlabelnode=list(
    c(Group="A",Sex="F",label="girl"),
    c(Group="A",Sex="M",label="boy"),
    c(Group="B",Sex="F",label="woman"),
    c(Group="B",Sex="M",label="man")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Group Sex",horiz=FALSE,
  labelnode=list(Group=c(Child="A",Adult="B")),
  tlabelnode=list(
    c(Group="A",Sex="F",label="girl"),
    c(Group="A",Sex="M",label="boy"),
    c(Group="B",Sex="F",label="woman"),
    c(Group="B",Sex="M",label="man")),
  width=700,height=250,pxwidth=800,imageheight="2.2in")`


## Text and text formatting {#textFormatting}

`Graphviz`,
the open source graph visualization software that `vtree` is built on,
supports a variety of text formatting (including boldface, colors, etc.).
This is used in `vtree` to control formatting of text such as node labels.


### Markdown-style codes for text formatting

By default, the `vtree` package uses markdown-style codes for text formatting.

* `\n` means insert a line break
* `\n*l` means make the preceding line left-justified and insert a line break
* `*...*` means display text in italics
* `**...**` means display text in bold
* `^...^` means display text in superscript (using 10 point font)
* `~...~` means display text in subscript (using 10 point font)
* `%%red ...%%` means display text in red (or whichever color is specified)


### HTML-like codes for text formatting

As an alternative,
if you specify `HTMLtext=TRUE` you can use "HTML-like labels"
(implemented in `Graphviz`), including:

* `<BR/>` means insert a line break
* `<BR ALIGN='LEFT'/>` means make the preceding line left-justified and insert a line break
* `<I> ... </I>` means display text in italics
* `<B> ... </B>` means display text in bold
* `<SUP> ... </SUP>` means display text in superscript,
  but note that the font size does not change
* `<SUB> ... </SUB>` means display text in subscript
  but again note that the font size does not change
* `<FONT POINT-SIZE='10'> ... </FONT>` means set font to 10 point
* `<FONT FACE='Times-Roman'> ... </FONT>` means set font to Times-Roman
* `<FONT COLOR='red'> ... </FONT>` means set font to red

See <https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/shapes.html#html> for more details.


### Adding text to nodes using the `text` parameter

Suppose you wish to add the italicized text "*Excluding new diagnoses*"
to any Mild nodes in the tree.
The parameter `text` lets you add text to nodes.
It is specified as a list with an element named for each variable.
In the example below the list has one element, named `Severity`.
That element in turn is a vector `c(Mild="\n*Excluding\nnew diagnoses*")`
indicating that the Mild node should include additional text using Markdown-style formatting
(i.e. there is a linebreak and the asterisks around the text indicate that it should be displayed in italics):

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Group Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,
  text=list(Severity=c(Mild="\n*Excluding\nnew diagnoses*")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Group Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,
  text=list(Severity=c(Mild="\n*Excluding\nnew diagnoses*")),
  width=450,height=150,pxwidth=1200,imageheight="2.5in")`
  

### Targeted text using the `ttext` parameter

In the example above,
suppose that new diagnoses are only excluded from Mild cases in `Group` B.
But the `text` parameter is used to add text to *all* Mild nodes.
Thus, in situations like this, the `text` parameter is not sufficient.
Instead, you can use the `ttext` parameter to target
exactly which nodes should have the specified text.

The `ttext` parameter requires that you specify the full path from the root of the tree to the node in question,
along with the text in question.
The `ttext` parameter is specified as a list so that multiple targeted text strings can be specified at once.
For example:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Group Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,
  ttext=list(
    c(Group="B",Severity="Mild",text="\n*Excluding\nnew diagnoses*"),
    c(Group="A",text="\nSweden"),
    c(Group="B",text="\nNorway")))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Group Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,
  ttext=list(c(Group="B",Severity="Mild",text="\n*Excluding\nnew diagnoses*"),
    c(Group="A",text="\nSweden"),c(Group="B",text="\nNorway")),
  width=450,height=150,pxwidth=1000,imageheight="2.5in")`
  

## Specification of variables {#VariableSpecification}
 
For convenience,
`vtree` allows you to specify variable names (separated by whitespace)
in a single character string.
If, however, any of the variable names have internal spaces,
the variable names must be specified as a vector of character strings.
 
Additionally, there are several modifiers that can be used
to change the way variables are represented in a tree.
 
 
### prefix `is.na:`

If an individual variable name is preceded by `is.na:`,
that variable will be replaced by a missing value indicator in the variable tree.
(This differs from the `check.is.na` parameter, described later,
which is used to replace *all* of the specified variables with missing value indicators.)


### prefixes `stem:` and `rc:`

In datasets exported from [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/),
checkboxes are represented using multiple variables.
The `stem:` prefix makes it easier to work with them.
This is described in the section on [REDCap checkboxes](#REDCapCheckboxes)
later in this vignette.


### prefix `tri:` {#detectingOutliers}

The `tri:` prefix is useful for identifying values of a numeric variable
that are *extreme* compared to the other values in a node.
**Note:** Unlike other variable specifications,
which take effect at the level of the entire data frame,
the `tri:` prefix takes effect within each node.

The effect of this variable specification
is to *trichotomize* the values of a numeric variable,
i.e. to divide them into three groups:
 
* "mid": values within plus or minus 1.5&times;IQR of the median,

* "high": values more than 1.5&times;IQR above the median,

* "low": values more than 1.5&times;IQR below the median.


### suffix `*`

Specifying `Ind*` matches all variable names that start with `Ind`.
In `FakeData` these are `Ind1`, `Ind2`, and `Ind3`.

The `*` suffix matches all variable names


### suffix `#`

Specifying `Ind#` matches all variable names that start with `Ind`
and end with a numeric digit, namely `Ind1`, `Ind2`, and `Ind3`.
(In this particular case, this is the same result as using `Ind*`).


### specification `variable=value` {#dichotomizing}

When a variable takes on a large number of different values,
the resulting variable tree will very large.
One solution is to prune the tree,
for example by keeping just the node corresponding to one value of a particular variable.
An alternative is to specify the value of the variable that is of primary interest and 
`vtree` will dichotomize the variable at that value.
For example if `Severity=Mild` is specified,
the `Severity` variable will be dichotomized between `Mild` and `Not Mild`.


### specifications `variable<value`, `variable>value`

These two specifications are used to dichotomize a *numeric* variable,
splitting above and below a specified value.
This can be useful for identifying subsets with extreme values.


## Displaying summary statistics in nodes {#summary}

It is often useful to display information about other variables
(apart from those that define the tree) in the nodes of a variable tree.
This is particularly useful for numeric variables,
which generally cannot be used to build the tree since they have too many distinct values.
For example, we might wish to display the mean age for individuals in each node.
Or we might wish to list the ID numbers of the individuals in each node.
The `summary` argument can be used to flexibly specify additional information to display.


### A simple example

The argument of the `summary` parameter is a character string with the following structure:

* It starts with the name of the variable for which a summary is desired. (We'll see later that variable specifications and expressions can also be used, as long as they do not contain any spaces.)

* Next there is a space.

* The remainder of the string specifies what to display,
with text as well as special codes to indicate the type of summary desired and to control which nodes display the summary, etc.

For example `%mean%` indicates that the mean of the specified variable should be shown.
Thus to display the mean of the numeric variable `Score`,
you could specify `summary="Score \nmean score: %mean%"`.
Note that the part of the string following the first space is
`"\nmean score: %mean%"`.
This specifies that in each node, after the usual frequency and percentage,
the summary should start on a new line with the words "mean score: " followed by the mean.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",summary="Score \nmean score: %mean%",sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",summary="Score \nmean score: %mean%",
  sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE,
  width=450,height=150,pxwidth=1000,imageheight="1.6in")`
  

To see the means without any decimals, the `cdigits` parameter can be used;
for example:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",summary="Score \nmean score: %mean%",cdigits=0,
  sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE)
```


The following codes can be used to show summary information:

code            | result
:---------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------
`%mean%`        |  mean
`%SD%`          |  standard deviation
`%sum%`         |  sum
`%min%`         |  minimum
`%max%`         |  maximum
`%pX%`          |  Xth percentile (e.g. `p50` means the 50th percentile)
`%median%`      |  median, i.e. p50
`%IQR%`         |  IQR, i.e. p25, p75
`%npct%`        |  frequency and percentage of a logical variable. By default "valid percentages" are used. Any missing values are also reported.     
`%pct%`         |  same as `%npct%` but percentage only (with no parentheses).
`%list%`        |  list of individual values, separated by commas
`%listlines%`   |  list of individual values, each on a separate line
`%mv%`          |  the number of missing values
`%nonmv%`       |  the number of non-missing values
`%v%`           |  the name of the variable

The `summary` argument can use any number of these codes,
mixed with text and formatting codes.


### More than one variable

Sometimes it is useful to display summary information for more than one variable.
To do this, specify `summary` as a vector of character strings:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,splitwidth=Inf,sameline=TRUE,
  summary=c("Score \nScore: mean (SD) %mean% (%SD%)","Pre \nPre: range %min%, %max%"))
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,splitwidth=Inf,sameline=TRUE,
  summary=c(
    "Score \nScore: mean (SD) %mean% (%SD%)",
    "Pre \nPre: range %min%, %max%"),
  width=650,height=350,pxwidth=1000,imageheight="1.5in")`
  

### The `%list%` code

It is sometimes convenient to see individual values of a variable in each node.
For example you might want to see ID numbers.
To do this, use the `%list%` code.
By default this information will be displayed in each node.
When a value occurs more than once in the subset,
it will be followed by a count of the number of repetitions in parentheses.
The `%list%` code separates values by commas.
Alternatively, the `%listlines%` code can be used to put each value on a new line.

When there are many IDs, it is often convenient to truncate the output.
If you specify `%trunc=`*N*`%`, summary information
will be truncated after *N* characters with "...".

### The `%noroot%`, `%leafonly%`, `%var=`*v*`%`, and `%node=`*n*`%` codes

By default, summary information is shown in all nodes.
However, it may also be convenient to only show it in specific nodes.
The following codes are available:

**code**         | **summary information restricted to:**
-----------------|----------------------------------------
`%noroot%`       | all nodes *except* the root
`%leafonly%`     | leaf nodes
`%var=`*v*`%`    | nodes of variable *v*
`%node=`*n*`%`   | nodes named *n*


### Specification of variables in the summary argument

Variables in the `summary` parameter can also be specified in a way similar
to the [specification of variables](#VariableSpecification) for structuring a variable tree.
For example, if we wish to know the proportion of patients in each node whose `Category` is single,
we specify `Category=single` in the `summary` argument.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity",summary="Category=single \n%pct% single",sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity",summary="Category=single \n%pct% single", 
  horiz=FALSE,sameline=TRUE,
  width=450,height=150,pxwidth=800,imageheight="1.3in")`
  

Continuous variables such as `Score` can be dichotomized using
notation such as `Score>10` or `Score<20`.


### R expressions in the summary argument

Rather than starting the `summary` argument with a variable name,
an R expression involving variables in the data frame can be given,
as long as it does not contain any spaces.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Category",
  summary="(Post-Pre)/Pre \nmean = %mean%",sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE,cdigits=1)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Category",
  summary="(Post-Pre)/Pre \nmean = %mean%",sameline=TRUE,horiz=FALSE,cdigits=1,
  width=450,height=150,pxwidth=1000,imageheight="2in")`

Expressions involving functions can also be used; for example `sqrt(abs(Post/Pre))`.


## Pattern trees and pattern tables {#patterns}

Each node in a variable tree provides the frequency of a particular combination
of values of the variables.
The leaf nodes represent *all* the observed combinations of values of all of the variables.
For example, in a variable tree for `Severity` and `Sex`,
the leaf nodes correspond to Mild F, Mild M, Moderate F, Moderate M, etc.
These combinations, or "patterns", can be treated as an additional variable.
And if this new pattern variable is used as the first variable in a tree,
then the branches of the tree will be simplified:
each branch will represent a unique pattern, with no sub-branches.
A "pattern tree" can be easily produced by specifying `pattern=TRUE`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex")
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",pattern=TRUE)
```
```{r, echo=FALSE,results="asis"}
cat(vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",
  width=650,height=650,pxwidth=500,imageheight="4in"))
#filepath <- grVizToPNG(v14,width=800))

cat("&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;")

cat(vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",pattern=TRUE,
  width=650,height=650,pxwidth=600,imageheight="4in"))
#filepath2 <- grVizToPNG(v15,width=800)
#![](`r filepath`){ height=4in } &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ![](`r filepath2`){ height=4in }
```


Pattern trees are easier to read than ordinary variable trees,
but they involve a considerable loss of information,
since they only represent the *n*th-level subsets
(where *n* is the number of variables).

Note that by default, when `pattern=TRUE` is specified,
the root node is not shown (in order to simplify the display).
A disadvantage of this is that the total sample size is not shown.
You can override this behavior by specifying `showroot=TRUE`.

A pattern tree has two other special characteristics.
First, note that after the first level (representing `pattern`),
counts and percentages are not shown,
since they are not informative:
by definition, all nodes within a branch have the same count.
Second, note that in place of arrows, undirected line segments are shown.
This is because, unlike in a regular variable tree,
the order of variables is irrelevant in a pattern tree.
Sometimes, however, the variables do have a natural ordering,
as in the case of longitudinal variables.
To show arrows, specify `seq=TRUE` instead of `pattern=TRUE`,
and a "sequence" (i.e. an ordered pattern) will be shown.

Summaries can be shown in pattern trees
(using the `summary` parameter), but they only appear in the pattern node
(or the sequence node if `seq=TRUE`).


### Pattern tables

A pattern tree has the same structure as a table.
Indeed, it may be more convenient to produce a table rather than a tree.
A data frame containing the information from the pattern tree 
can be exported by specifying `ptable=TRUE`:

```{r}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",ptable=TRUE)
```

The pattern table includes a column for the counts from the pattern nodes,
and a column for percentages.
Compared to a variable tree, this table is much more compact,
and may be more suitable for use in a manuscript.

### Indicator variables

Pattern trees are useful for *indicator variables*,
i.e. variables that take values like 0/1, no/yes, FALSE/TRUE, etc.
For convenience in this section,
we'll refer to 0 (or no, FALSE, etc.) as a *negative*
and 1 (or yes, TRUE, etc.) as an *affirmative*.

The variables `Ind1` through `Ind4` in `FakeData` are 0/1 indicator variables.
If these variables are interpreted as representing set membership
(0 = non-member, 1 = member),
then a pattern tree is an alternative representation of a Venn diagram.
If you specify `Venn=TRUE`,
the nodes (except for the pattern nodes) will be blank,
with only their shade indicating their value
(dark = 1, light = 0, white = missing).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2 Ind3 Ind4",Venn=TRUE,pattern=TRUE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2 Ind3 Ind4",Venn=TRUE,pattern=TRUE,
  width=650,height=650,pxwidth=600,imageheight="6in")`

A pattern tree for indicator variables provides all the information that a Venn diagram represents,
but unlike a Venn diagram, missing values are also represented.
This can also be shown as a pattern table.
For example:

```{r}
vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2",ptable=TRUE)
```

#### The `VennTable` function

For indicator variables, there is an extra function, `VennTable`,
which converts the pattern table to a matrix of character strings
and adds some additional totals.

```{r}
VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2",ptable=TRUE))
```

By default in R, when a matrix of character strings is printed,
quotation marks are displayed around each element.
Unfortunately the result is unattractive.
Instead it's helpful to call the `print` function and specify `quote=FALSE`:

```{r}
print(VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2",ptable=TRUE)),quote=FALSE)
```

Without all those quotation marks, it's easier to see what `VennTable` adds:

* the total sample size (`r nrow(FakeData)`) and percentage (100), and

* the total number (N) of affirmatives for each variable, together with a percentage.

The `VennTable` function can also be used in an R Markdown document.
Specifying `markdown=TRUE` generates a pandoc markdown pipetable,
with several formatting tweaks:

* the rows and columns of the table are transposed

* affirmatives are represented by checkmarks

* negatives are represented by spaces

* missing values are represented by dashes (which can be changed with the `NAcode` parameter).

To display the table in R Markdown, use this inline call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2",ptable=TRUE),markdown=TRUE)`
```

`r VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Ind1 Ind2",ptable=TRUE),markdown=TRUE)`

`VennTable` has some additional parameters.
The `checked` parameter is used to specify values that should be interpreted as affirmative.
By default, it is set to `c("1","TRUE","Yes","yes","N/A")`.
Similarly, the `unchecked` parameter is used to specify values that should be interpreted as negative,
with default `c("0","FALSE","No","no","not N/A")`.

#### Using the `summary` parameter in pattern tables

The `summary` parameter can also be used in pattern tables.
If a single summary is requested,
it appears in the `summary_1` variable in the data frame.
Additional summaries appear as `summary_2`, `summary_3`, etc.

```{r}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",summary=c("Score %mean%","Pre %mean%"),ptable=TRUE)
```

### Checking for missing values with the `check.is.na` parameter {#missingValues}

If `check.is.na=TRUE` is specified,
each variable is replaced by an indicator of whether or not it is missing,
and `pattern=TRUE` is automatically set.
As when `Venn=TRUE` is specified, all nodes except for the pattern node are blank,
and only their shade indicates missing (dark) or not (light).
Whereas the variables used to build a variable tree are normally categorical,
in this situation non-categorical variables can be used,
because their missingness is represented instead of their actual values.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Age Pre Post",check.is.na=TRUE)
```

`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Age Pre Post",check.is.na=TRUE,
  width=700,height=370,pxwidth=600,imageheight="3in")`

Specifying `ptable=TRUE` produces this information in a data frame,
and calling `VennTable` shows additional information.
To display the table in R Markdown, use this inline call:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Severity Age Pre Post",check.is.na=TRUE,ptable=TRUE),
   markdown=TRUE)`
```

`r VennTable(vtree(FakeData,"Severity Age Pre Post",check.is.na=TRUE,ptable=TRUE),markdown=TRUE)`

The rows `n` and `pct` represent the frequency and percentage
of the total number of cases for each pattern of missingness,
and the columns `N` and `pct` on the right-hand side represent the frequency and percentage
of missingness for each variable.

It may be useful to identify the ID numbers for these patterns.
Here the results are truncated to 15 characters:

```{r}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Age Pre Post",check.is.na=TRUE,summary="id %list%%trunc=15%",
  ptable=TRUE)
```


## REDCap checkboxes {#REDCapCheckboxes}

In datasets exported from [REDCap](https://www.project-redcap.org/),
checkboxes (i.e. the boxes where you select all that apply)
are represented in a special way.
For each item in a checklist, a separate variable is created.
Suppose survey respondents were asked to select which flavors of ice cream (Chocolate, Vanilla, Strawberry) they like.
Within REDCap,
the variable name for this list of checkboxes is `IceCream`,
but when the dataset is exported,
individual variables `IceCream___1` (representing Chocolate), 
`IceCream___2` (Vanilla), and `IceCream___3` (Strawberry) are created.
When the dataset is read into R,
the names of the flavors are embedded in the `attributes` of these variables.

### prefix `stem:`

`vtree` includes a feature designed to make REDCap checkbox variables easier to use.
Instead of typing:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vtree(MyREDCapData,"IceCream___1 IceCream___2 IceCream___3")
```

you can use a special syntax where `stem:` precedes the REDCap variable name:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vtree(MyREDCapData,"stem:IceCream")
```

By default,
`vtree` will also extract the names of the choices and create variables with those names.
(This can be disabled by specifying `choicechecklist=FALSE`.)

An especially convenient way to display checkbox variables with `vtree` is:

```{r eval=FALSE}
vtree(MyREDCapData,"stem:IceCream",pattern=TRUE,showroot=FALSE)
```

### prefix `rc:`

Alternatively, if you wish to only examine specific REDCap checkbox items,
the `rc:` prefix can be used.
For example to examine results for just Chocolate and Strawberry:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(MyREDCapData,"rc:IceCream___1 rc:IceCream___3",pattern=TRUE,showroot=FALSE)
```


## Examining the DOT script generated by `vtree`

Specifying `getscript=TRUE` lets you capture the DOT script representing a variable tree.
(DOT is a graph description language used by Graphviz, which is used by DiagrammeR, which is used by `vtree`!).
Here is an example:

```{r, comment=""}
dotscript <- vtree(FakeData,"Severity",getscript=TRUE)
cat(dotscript)
```

If you wish to directly edit this code,
it can can be pasted into an online Graphviz editor,
for example:

https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline

http://magjac.com/graphviz-visual-editor/



# Ways to call vtree

`vtree` behaves differently depending on the context in which it is called.


## Calling vtree interactively 

* If `vtree` is called interactively in RStudio, it displays the variable tree in the Viewer window.

* If `vtree` is called interactively from the RGui console
(i.e. from R outside of RStudio),
it displays the variable tree in a browser window.


## Calling vtree from R Markdown {#embeddingInRmarkdown}

`vtree` has a number of special features when called from R Markdown
By default, when `vtree` is called from R Markdown,
it generates a PNG image file.

Here's how it does that. `vtree` uses the `DiagrammeR` package,
which automatically generates an htmlwidget for display in HTML,
using the [htmlwidgets](https://www.htmlwidgets.org/) framework.
Then `vtree` converts the htmlwidget into a PNG. 
 
### Generating PNG files

PNG files are useful because they allow you to display variable trees in Microsoft Word documents,
and also because HTML files that use htmlwidgets can get large,
and if they contain several widgets they can be slow to load.

If `vtree` is called while an R Markdown file is being knitted,
it generates a PNG file and automatically embeds it into the knitted document.
The resolution of the PNG file in pixels is determined by parameters `pxwidth` and `pxheight`.
If neither is specified, `pxwidth` is automatically set to 2000,
which provides good resolution for a printed page.
The height of the image in the R Markdown output document can be specified 
using the `imageheight` parameter,
for example `imageheight="4in"` for a 4-inch image.
There is also an `imagewidth` parameter.
If neither is specified, `imageheight` is automatically set to 3 inches.

The PNG file is stored in the folder specified by the `folder` parameter,
or if not specified, a temporary folder will be used.
Successive PNG files are named `vtree1.png`, `vtree2.png`, 
and so forth and are stored in the  folder.
During knitting, `vtree` uses the `options` function in base R to store
a variable called `vtcount` to count the PNG files,
and a variable called `vtfolder` to identify the fodler where they will be stored.

To call `vtree` in R Markdown, you can use inline code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r vtree(FakeData,"Sex Severity")`
```

Or you can use a code chunk:

````
`r ''````{r, results="asis"}
cat(vtree(FakeData,"Sex Severity"))
```
````

One advantage of code chunks is that they can also be run interactively
(for example within RStudio, by clicking on the green arrow at the top right of a code chunk).


### Generating an htmlwidget in an HTML document

When knitting to an HTML document, 
an htmlwidget can be used rather than embedding a PNG file.
(In fact PNG files are generated from htmlwidgets via SVG format.)
To use an htmlwidget instead of a PNG file, you can use inline code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
`r vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",pngknit=FALSE)`
```

Or a code chunk:

````
`r ''````{r}
vtree(FakeData,"Severity Sex",pngknit=FALSE)
```
````

Note the differences between this and the code chunk (in the previous section) to produce a PNG file:
(1) you specify `pngknit=FALSE`,
(2) you don't specify the chunk option `results="asis"`,
and (3) you don't put `cat` around the call to `vtree`.


# Generating a data frame by specifying subset sizes {#GeneratingDataFrames}

`vtree` is designed to generate a variable tree based on a data frame.
However, sometimes no data frame is available, but the sizes of subsets are known.

The `build.data.frame` function allows you to build a data frame by specifying the size of subsets.
Here's an example involving pets:

```{r}
build.data.frame(
  c("pet","breed","size"),
  list("dog","golden retriever","large",5),
  list("cat","tabby","small",2))
```

In this case there are five large golden retrievers and 2 small tabby cats.
Although a data frame like this could easily be created without using `build.data.frame`,
it’s a different situation when the counts are large.
For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(build.data.frame(
  c("pet","breed","size"),
  list("dog","golden retriever","large",5),
  list("cat","tabby","small",2),
  list("dog","Dalmation","various",101),
  list("cat","Abyssinian","small",5),
  list("cat","Abyssinian","large",22),
  list("cat","tabby","large",86)))
```

`r vtree(build.data.frame(
  c("pet","breed","size"),
  list("dog","golden retriever","large",5),
  list("cat","tabby","small",2),
  list("dog","Dalmation","various",101),
  list("cat","Abyssinian","small",5),
  list("cat","Abyssinian","large",22),
  list("cat","tabby","large",86)),
  imagewidth="4in",pxwidth=800)`


# Examples

## Rudimentary CONSORT diagrams

Consider the following fictitious data about a randomized controlled trial (RCT):

```{r}
FakeRCT
```

The CONSORT diagram (http://www.consort-statement.org/) shows the flow of patients through the study,
starting with those who meet eligibility criteria,
then those who are randomized, etc.
It is easy to produce a rudimentary version of a CONSORT diagram in `vtree`.
The key step is to prune branches for those who are *not* eligible, *not* randomized, etc.
This can be done using the `keep` parameter:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  keep=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility")
```

`r vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  keep=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility",
  width=230,height=500,pxwidth=400,imageheight="6in")`
  

Note that this does not include all of the additional information for a full CONSORT diagram
(exclusion reasons and counts,
as well as numbers of patients who received their allocated interventions,
who discontinued intervention, and who were excluded from analysis).
It does, however, provide the main flow information.

Additional information can be obtained by viewing the nodes for patients in the 
pruned branches (but not their descendants).
The `follow` parameter makes that easy:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  follow=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility")
```

`r vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  follow=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility",
  width=400,height=500,pxwidth=600,imageheight="6in")`

Finally, it may be useful to see the ID numbers in each node.
This can be done using the `summary` parameter with the `%list%` code.
Since IDs are less useful in the root note,
the `%noroot%` code is also specified here:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  follow=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility",
  summary="id \nid: %list% %noroot%")
```

`r vtree(FakeRCT,"eligible randomized group followup analyzed",plain=TRUE,
  follow=list(eligible="Eligible",randomized="Randomized",followup="Followed up"),
  horiz=FALSE,showvarnames=FALSE,title="Assessed for eligibility",
  summary="id \nid: %list% %noroot%",
  width=500,height=600,pxwidth=700,imageheight="6in")`


## Examples using R datasets {#RdatasetExamples}

The `datasets` package is loaded in R by default.
In the following section,
`vtree` is applied to several of these data sets for illustrative purposes.
Note that the variable trees generated by the commands below are not shown.
The reader can try these commands to see what the variable trees look like,
and experiment with many other possibilities.


### Esophageal cancer

The `esoph` data set
(data from a case-control study of esophageal cancer in Ille-et-Vilaine, France), 
has 88 different combinations of age group, alcohol consumption, and tobacco consumption.
Let's examine the total number of cases and the total number of controls
among patients aged 75 and older compared to the rest of the patients:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(esoph,"agegp=75+",sameline=TRUE,cdigits=0,
  summary=c("ncases \ncases=%sum%%leafonly%","ncontrols  controls=%sum%%leafonly%"))
```


### Hair and eye color

The `HairEyeColor` data set is an array representing a contingency table
(also called a crosstab or crosstabulation).
Before `vtree` can be applied to this data set,
it is necessary to convert the table of crosstabulated frequencies to a data frame of cases.
For convenience, the `vtree` package includes a helper function to do this,
called `crosstabToCases`.
It is adapted from a function listed on the [Cookbook for R website](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Manipulating_data/Converting_between_data_frames_and_contingency_tables/#countstocases-function)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
hec <- crosstabToCases(HairEyeColor)
```

There are a lot of combinations but let's say we are especially interested
in green eyes (as compared to non-green eyes).
We can use the variable specification `Eye=Green` to do this: 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(hec,"Hair Eye=Green Sex",sameline=TRUE)
```


### Titanic

The `Titanic` dataset is a 4-dimensional array of counts.
First, let's convert it to a dataframe of individuals:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
titanic <- crosstabToCases(Titanic)
```

We'll specify `sameline=TRUE` so that the variable tree is a bit more compact:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(titanic,"Class Sex Age",summary="Survived=Yes \n%pct% survived",sameline=TRUE)
```


### mtcars

The `mtcars` data set was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine,
and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and
performance for 32 automobiles (1973–74 models).

The rownames of the data set contain the names of the cars.
Let's move that information into a column.
To do that, we'll make a slightly altered version of the data frame which we'll call `mt`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
mt <- mtcars
mt$name <- rownames(mt)
rownames(mt) <- NULL
```

Now let's look at the mean and standard deviation of horsepower (HP)
by number of carburetors, nested within number of gears,
and in turn nested within number of cylinders:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(mt,"cyl gear carb",summary="hp \nmean (SD) HP %mean% (%SD%)")
```

The above shows the mean and SD of horsepower by
(1) number of cylinders;
(2) number of gears (within number of cylinders);
and 
(3) number of carburetors (within number of gears nested within number of cylinders).
That's a lot of information.
Suppose instead that we are only interested in number 3 above,
i.e. all combinations of number of cylinders, number of gears, and number of carburetors.

In that case, we can specify `ptable=TRUE`, 
To make the table a little easier to read,
set the number of digits for the mean and SD to be zero,
and relabel the variables.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(mt,"cyl gear carb",summary="hp mean (SD) HP %mean% (%SD%)",
  cdigits=0,labelvar=c(cyl="# cylinders",gear="# gears",carb="# carburetors"),
  ptable=TRUE)
```

We might also like to list the names of cars by number of carburetors
nested within number of gears:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(mt,"gear carb",summary="name \n%list%%noroot%",splitwidth=50,sameline=TRUE,
  labelvar=c(gear="# gears",carb="# carburetors"))
```
  

### UCBAdmissions

The `UCBAdmissions` data is consists of aggregate data on
applicants to graduate school at Berkeley for the six largest departments in 1973
classified by admission and sex.
According to the data set Details,
"This data set is frequently used for illustrating Simpson's paradox,
see Bickel et al. (1975).
At issue is whether the data show evidence of sex bias in admission practices.
There were 2691 male applicants, of whom 1198 (44.5%) were admitted,
compared with 1835 female applicants of whom 557 (30.4%) were admitted."
Furthermore,
"the apparent association between admission and sex stems from
differences in the tendency of males and females to apply to the individual departments
(females used to apply more to departments with higher rejection rates)."

First, we'll convert the crosstab data to a data frame of cases, `ucb`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ucb <- crosstabToCases(UCBAdmissions)
```

Next, let's look at admission rates by Gender, nested within department:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(ucb,"Dept Gender",summary="Admit=Admitted \n%pct% admitted",sameline=TRUE)
```


### ChickWeight

The `ChickWeight` data set is from an experiment on the effect of diet on early growth of chicks.
Let's look at the mean weight of chicks at birth (0 days of age) and 4 days of age,
nested within type of diet.
A simple variable tree can be produced like this:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(ChickWeight,"Diet Time",keep=list(Time=c("0","4")),summary="weight \nmean weight %mean%g")
```

To make the display a little easier to read, relabel the nodes
and the `Time` variable:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(ChickWeight,"Diet Time",keep=list(Time=c("0","4")),
  labelnode=list(
    Diet=c("Diet 1"="1","Diet 2"="2","Diet 3"="3","Diet 4"="4"),
    Time=c("0 days"="0","4 days"="4")),
  labelvar=c(Time="Days since birth"),summary="weight \nmean weight %mean%g")
```


### InsectSprays

The `InsectSprays` data set contains
counts of insects in agricultural experimental units treated with different insecticides.
Let's look at those counts by insecticide.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(InsectSprays,"spray",splitwidth=80,sameline=TRUE,
  summary="count \ncounts: %list%%noroot%",cdigits=0)
```


### ToothGrowth

The `ToothGrowth` data set contains
the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs.
Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day)
by one of two delivery methods,
orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).

Let's examine the percentage with length > 20 by dose nested within delivery method:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(ToothGrowth,"supp dose",summary="len>20 \n%pct% length > 20")
```

To make the display a little easier to read, relabel the nodes
and the `Time` variable:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vtree(ToothGrowth,"supp dose",summary="len>20 \n%pct% length > 20",
  labelvar=c("supp"="Supplement type","dose"="Dose (mg/day)"),
  labelnode=list(supp=c("Vitamin C"="VC","Orange Juice"="OJ")))
```
